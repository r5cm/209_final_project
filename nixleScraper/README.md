nixleScraper
========

This python script scrapes [nixle](http://www.nixle.com) alerts on their site, and saves them as csv file. Currently it is scraping from [Sonoma County Sheriff's Office](https://local.nixle.com/sonoma-county-sheriffs-office).

To run the script, install dependencies from requirements.txt, then run `python main.py`. The output is at `latest.csv`.
