Recognizing and avoiding these schemes may be the most effective way to fight this kind of crime.', 'In this type of scam, the suspect typically makes contact by telephone or e-mail and pretends to be a police officer, federal agent or some other government official. The suspect claims the victim has an arrest warrant, unpaid taxes or some other legal liability that must be paid immediately. In some cases, the suspect has personal information about the victim (likely from an old Internet data breach) and even “spoofs” their caller ID or e-mail to make it appear they are legitimate. The suspect then demands immediate payment from the victim, often in the form of wire transfers, pre-paid debit cards, cryptocurrency or some other unusual method. The suspect will likely continue to make threats and demands for money until the victim stops cooperating.', 'Federal, state and local government officials do not demand immediate payment by telephone or e-mail to prevent imminent arrest or collect taxes. If you actually owe taxes or face some other legal liability, the government must follow a routine procedure which allows you an opportunity to review and appeal the claim. In the case of criminal charges or a warrant, law enforcement agencies do not accept payment to prevent arrest – a court hearing is required.', 'If you are targeted by this type of scam, do not make any payments or provide any personal information to the suspect.

Reporting these types of scams to authorities may help direct resources to combating the problem, but you should also know it can be difficult to identify and hold accountable the suspects in any specific incident. Recognizing and avoiding these schemes may be the most effective way to fight this kind of crime.', 'In one type of scam, the suspect uses social media, a dating website or a messaging app to find potential victims and gather their personal information. The suspect initiates a conversation that leads to a request to share nude or sexually explicit photos or video (the suspect might also participate, and often asks for the victim’s face to be visible). The suspect saves any images the victim shares and then demands money by threatening to send the images to the victim’s contacts.', 'A similar scam - usually a hoax - involves an email from someone claiming to have accessed your computer remotely and captured images of you while you were visiting a pornographic website. The suspect might even include a password or other personal information of yours (likely from an old data breach) to convince you the threat is real. The suspect threatens to share the alleged images with others if you do not pay.', 'To help avoid these scams, try keep your social media contact lists and personal information settings as private as possible, and carefully evaluate unexpected social media requests and messages. It’s a good idea to use strong passwords (with two-step verification if available), updating them frequently and using different passwords for different services. If you have been impacted by these scams, it is likely the perpetrator will continue to make threats if you meet the first demand for money, and will eventually release the images (if they actually have any) when you stop cooperating. For this reason we do not recommend making any payments.', 'Instead, end the communication and block or restrict the suspect’s access to your social media accounts to whatever degree this is possible. Preserve any information about the suspect that you might have (messages, identifying information, images) in case you decide to file a police report. Report the suspect’s account to the site for inappropriate activity. Consider changing your profile name, photo and other public-facing information. If any images are posted, delete them or contact the site where they are posted to have them removed. You could also create a search engine alert to scan for any posted images so you can try to have them deleted.', 'The most difficult decision may be whether or not to warn your contacts the images might be posted. Asking your contacts to delete rather than review any images takes the suspect’s leverage away and helps reduce the element of surprise to others, but the idea of sending such a warning might be unbearably embarrassing and revealing. It’s more easily said than done, but it could help to take a long-run perspective – if the images are released you might be forced to deal with the immediate consequences, but in time the situation will run its course.
